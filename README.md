#### Question 1 : What is JSX, and why is it used?

State = Component's own memory  
Props = Instructions given to component

#### Question 3 :What is the useState hook, and how does it work?

**Syntax:** `const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);`

**Usage:** `setValue(newValue)` updates the state and re-renders the component.

#### Question 4 : How can you share state between components in React?
- Answer : **Ways to share state between components:**

1. **Lifting State Up** - Move state to common parent component
2. **Props** - Pass state down from parent to child
3. **Context API** - Share state across many components
4. **State Management Libraries** - Redux, Zustand for complex apps

**Most common:** Lift state to parent → pass via props to children
